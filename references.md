In addition to working on technical, business development and content creation stuff for Opetus.tv, here a things/projects/organizations I’ve been working with in the recent years:

## 2015

- Proof-of-concept stuff regarding [Abitti][abitti] system
	- Abitti system is the first official public version of the digital exam system that will be employed in high school final exams nation-wide starting in autumn 2016.
	- Created an editor that enables teachers to use text formatting including tables as well as images and sounds in exam questions in the Abitti system even though the Abitti system does not officially support anything but plaintext for questions at the time of creation in February 2015.
- Training sessions for high schools
	- Multiple training sessions for different high schools, including schools in Helsinki, Lohja and Porvoo, regarding the Abitti system and demonstrating on hands-on basis how to use the system.

## 2014

- [Matriculation Examination Board of Finland][ytl]
	- Project management as well as part of programming in developing [Ideabi.fi][ideabi], an idea sharing platform for teachers to use.
	- A research project regarding the possibilities of chemistry notation and 3D representation preferrably in a browser environment and available as open-source solutions. This was carried out be [Tiina Tähkä][tahka] from the Finnish National Board of Education, [Johannes Pernaa][pernaa] and me.
- [Suomen Vuokranantajat][vuokranantajat] (Finnish Landlords’ Association)
	- Security audit of their website
	- Helping to close a serious security hole that would have allowed an anonymous user to destroy their member by writing arbitrary data over all member records.
