## In a nutshell (TL;DR)

What browser development teams are currently (considering) working on:

- Chrome / Chromium / Blink engine: [chromestatus.com](https://www.chromestatus.com)
- Firefox: [platform-status.mozill.org](https://platform-status.mozilla.org/)
- Safari / WebKit: [webkit.org/status/](https://webkit.org/status/)
- Microsoft Edge: [status.microsoftedge.com](https://status.microsoftedge.com)

## Background

Out of curiosity I was just reading the [Blink web engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(web_engine))'s Wikipedia page; Blink is used in Chrome/Chromium, Opera, Android WebView, etc. etc. and my interest for it stems from cross-browser extension development. On Aug. 2, 2016 Mozilla shipped v48.0 of the Firefox browser which was the first to have their Chrome-compatible [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/fi/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) feature enabled by default. Microsoft [Edge seems to be following suit](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/extensions/api-support/extension-api-roadmap/) which is great.


## Chromestatus.com

BUT, that was beside the point of this article. At the bottom of the [Blink Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(web_engine)) I spotted a link to:

> [CHROMESTATUS.COM](https://www.chromestatus.com)

Upon taking a quick look I noticed that there's for example a [list of proposed new API's and features](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#browsers.chrome.status%3A%22Proposed%22) as well as how other browser makers have reacted to the initiative. For example an [Asynchronous Clipboard API](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5861289330999296) with a [draft](https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/), [documentation samples](https://github.com/garykac/clipboard/blob/master/clipboard.md) and [discussion](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-modern-asynchronous-clipboard-api/1513). Public support is indicated by all major browsers.

After browsing around I came across a link to this video regarding how the *chromestatus.com* was build:

## Other browsers' development status pages

In the previous video Google engineer [Eric Bidelman](https://plus.google.com/+EricBidelman) ([@ebidel](https://twitter.com/ebidel), [GitHub](https://github.com/ebidel), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericbidelman)) mentions that Mozilla/Firefox, Safari/WebKit and Microsoft Edge also have similar development status sites as *chromestatus.com*.

So here it is, (the same) list of browser development status sites:

- Chrome / Chromium / Blink engine: [chromestatus.com](https://www.chromestatus.com)
- Firefox: [platform-status.mozill.org](https://platform-status.mozilla.org/)
- Safari / WebKit: [webkit.org/status/](https://webkit.org/status/)
- Microsoft Edge: [status.microsoftedge.com](https://status.microsoftedge.com)
