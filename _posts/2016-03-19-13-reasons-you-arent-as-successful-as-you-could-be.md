## Background

Came across this [Business Insider article](http://www.businessinsider.com/13-reasons-you-arent-as-successful-as-you-should-be-2016-3) on some good points / reminders mostly relating to attitude; factors that influence one's success in work and also life in general.

## Should vs. could

The Business Insider article is entitled *"13 reasons you aren't as successful as you **should** be"*. The article starts with:

> If you're not quite where you expected to be, you probably spend time wondering why.

So the context is the thought that *"I've put in so and so much effort but have not reached what I expected to reach after having put in that effort."*

Nevertheless, using the word ***should*** also subconsciously implies or brings to mind success as defined by the business world which often revolves around money, possessions etc. Hence I'll rather use the word ***could*** instead of *should*.

## The 13 points

The 13 points brought up by the BI article as reasons for not being as successful as one *could* be are are. I wrote my own one-line summaries for each bullet point. You may also want to read the summaries on the [BI article](http://www.businessinsider.com/13-reasons-you-arent-as-successful-as-you-should-be-2016-3):

1. *You don't believe in yourself.*
	- Self belief => action
2. *You engage in negativity.*
	- Try to see an opportunity in every difficulty/challenge 
3. *You follow the path of least resistance.*
	- Go and make it happen.
4. *You've lost sight of your goals.*
	- Set [BHAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal)s
5. *You spend too much time sitting around.*
	- Avoid laziness
6. *You are waiting for perfect.*
	- Done is better than perfect.
7. *You are easily distracted.*

9. *You hold on when you need to let go.*

10. *You make excuses rather than decisions.*
	- Don't put the blame on others (even if you could).

	- Need to be wise on this one; not a license to cutting corners.
12. *You overcomplicate everything.*
	- KISS principle
