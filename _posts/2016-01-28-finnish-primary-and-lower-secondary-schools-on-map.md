I utilized Google Maps, [Python](https://xkcd.com/353/) and standard webdesign frontend technologies to plot Finland's primary and lower secondary schools (grades 1-9) on a map:

[![Kartta Suomen peruskouluista](/img/suomen-peruskoulut.jpg)](/img/suomen-peruskoulut.jpg)

What partially surprised me was how many schools there are in the archipelago region between Turku and the Ã…land Islans (bottom-left / south-western part of the map).

The map acts sort of as a population density indicator as well.
