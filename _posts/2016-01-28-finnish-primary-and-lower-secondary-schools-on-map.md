I utilized Google Maps, [Python](https://xkcd.com/353/) and standard webdesign frontend technologies to plot Finnish primary and lower secondary schools (grades 1-9) on a map:

<a href="/img/finnish-primary-and-lower-secondary-schools.jpg" class="colorbox" title="Finnish primary and lower secondary schools on a map"><img src="/img/finnish-primary-and-lower-secondary-schools.jpg" alt="Finnish primary and lower secondary schools on a map"></a>

What partially surprised me was how many schools there are in the archipelago region between Turku and the Ã…land Islans (bottom-left / south-western part of the map).

The map acts sort of as a population density indicator as well.

What do you think? Please leave your comments/questions below :)
