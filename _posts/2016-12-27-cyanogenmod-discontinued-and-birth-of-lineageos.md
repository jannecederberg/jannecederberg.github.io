I had thought I would upgrade my OnePlus One from CyanogenMod 12.1 (Lollipop) to CyanogenMod 14 (Nougat) over the holidays.

Today I went to take a look at the CyanogenMod download and wiki pages for OnePlus One and was struck with something I didn't expect but that according to what I now read has been largely expected: **Cyanogen Inc is shutting down *CyanogenMod* builds and wiki**.

## LineageOS

In an announcement dated Dec 24, 2016 [LineageOS.org](http://lineageos.org/Yes-this-is-us/) states:

> So, yes, this is us. LineageOS will be a continuation of what CyanogenMod was. To quote Andy Rubin, this is the definition of open. A company pulling their support out of an open source project does not mean it has to die. Check back for more information on Tuesday.
