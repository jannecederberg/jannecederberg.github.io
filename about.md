Greetings friend! You’ve reached the personal website of [Janne Cederberg][twitter], the founder of [Opetus.tv][otv], which is kind of like Khan Academy but in Finnish, based on Finnish curriculum and created without outside funding. Our content is of higher pedagogical and technical quality than Khan Academy’s.

I used to work as a high math and IT teacher and tech admin before resigning in spring 2011 and starting work as an entrepreneur.

Recently, besides Opetus.tv, I’ve been working with the [Matriculation Examination Board of Finland][meb] regarding the [digitalization][digi] of high school final exams in Finland starting in 2016.

The articles on this blog will be, depending on content/context, either in English or in Finnish.

[Contact me][contact].
