Greetings friend!

You’ve reached the personal website of [Janne Cederberg][twitter], an entrepreneur, software developer, teacher and also a bit of a basketball coach.

I used to work as a high math and IT teacher and tech admin before resigning in spring 2011 and starting work as an entrepreneur. I'm the founder of [Opetus.tv][otv], which is kind of like Khan Academy but in Finnish, based on Finnish curriculum and created without outside funding.

Recently, besides Opetus.tv, I’ve been working with the [Matriculation Examination Board of Finland][meb] regarding the [digitalization][digi] of high school final exams in Finland starting in 2016 and have developed a [customized wireless access point called](https://nettiniilo.fi) to help with high school everyday life digitalization.

The articles on this site will be, depending on content/context, either in English or in Finnish.

[Contact me][contact].
